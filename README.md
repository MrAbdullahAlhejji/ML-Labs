1-Problem TypeThis is a Regression problem. Since we are aiming to predict a continuous numerical value (the number of accidents) rather than a category or label, regression algorithms will be the primary focus of this study.

2-Target VariableThe Target Variable (y) for this model is the column: Male(18-30).Goal: To predict the count of accidents involving males in the 18–30 age group.Features (X): Variables such as State/UT, Region Type (Rural/Urban), and other demographic indicators.

3-Problem Statement"This project aims to predict the number of road accidents involving the youth demographic (males aged 18–30) across various Indian states and cities. By leveraging historical data from 2021, the model will help identify high-risk regions. These insights can be used by policymakers to implement targeted safety measures and reduce the frequency of accidents in the most vulnerable areas."
